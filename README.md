# ORGO SNIxKWT

## Introduction 
### Problem statement: 

Humans and lions are dying. Lions are the apex predator to a globally valuable ecosystem threatened by drought, habitat loss, economic insecurity, and lack of proper funding. The urgency of the loss of life brings us to the core issue of the negotiation between human needs and ecosystem needs.

### Our Solution has three parts:
1. A mobile phone app to collect data about conflict events
2. Educating and engaging through art and to tell the story of the wildlife and its pressing needs
3. A marketplace for experts and activists to propose and fund solutions.
We sum this all up by creating a new Empathy DAO to foster permanent, beneficial relationships between humans and predators.
