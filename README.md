# ORGO SNIxKWT

## Introduction 
### Problem statement: 

Humans and lions are dying. Lions are the apex predator to a globally valuable ecosystem threatened by drought, habitat loss, economic insecurity, and lack of proper funding. The urgency of the loss of life brings us to the core issue of the negotiation between human needs and ecosystem needs.

### Our Solution has three parts:
1. A mobile phone app to collect data about conflict events
2. Educating and engaging through art and to tell the story of the wildlife and its pressing needs
3. A marketplace for experts and activists to propose and fund solutions.
We sum this all up by creating a new Empathy DAO to foster permanent, beneficial relationships between humans and predators.

## Getting Started
1. https://sni-kwt.vercel.app/ create an account and complete the mission to gain your Level 1 Lion Golem Avatar.
2. Level up by earning Empathy Points (EP) and gaining task, education, and philanthropy badges through collecting data, education, and sponsoring solutions.
3. Unlock new abilities like access to DAO governance, early access to NFTs, and more!


## About Empathy Points

As you view artwork, learn more about the lions, and participate in mitigation or data collection activities, you earn empathy points and level up your avatar. Empathy points are a proposed ERC-20 type token, which is issued by DAO governance. As the empathy points in your wallet accrue, you have the 

As you level up you gain greater access within the DAO to abilities such as governance, proposing fundraisers, paid gigs, and exclusive chatrooms.

## About the Missions App

ORGO has produced a web app prototype for this hackathon which showcases how the Empathy DAO will create missions designed to improve the empathy of individuals. The home page of the app is the task dashboard, or the list of missions. You can view the details and requirements for submitting to this mission including the use of mobile phone for data required. 

For example, one example task in the prototype asks you to upload photos and an investigative report on a dead lion found. One educational example is to watch a documentary and complete a quiz. All of these empathy point rewards are assigned by DAO governance, and are redeemed once your mission is verified complete.

Solutions funded by the marketplace also show up as special missions with cash rewards in addition to empathy points.

## About the Solutions Marketplace

We have prototyped the solutions marketplace to allow experts and activists with the most empathy points to propose solutions by listing project pages.

Project pages define a budget which assigns cash rewards for the missions required for project success. This works by having each task independently verified with supporting data, and end to end transparency of funds to the impact they produce.

These paid projects on the ground in kenya offer job opportunities to produce and install mitigation techniques which benefit humans, lions, or both.

Projects you fund also give you empathy points and accrue your philanthropic reputation, leading short term tourists a path to long term regenerative relationship with the human and non-human life in Kenya.

## About the Empathy DAO

The DAO functions to make the other parts of our solution possible, including administering missions creation, missions approval, mission rewards designations, and propose solutions in the marketplace. We will initialize the DAO with members of the KWT and other conservancies, the park rangers, the lion ambassadors, and existing philanthropists.

The DAO will use governance tools like snapshot with voting power from empathy points to approve and deny proposals regarding the above functions. In addition, other DAO tools will be used to distribute funds for paid gigs such as producing artworks and storytelling, marketing and social media awareness of the art and fundraiser.
